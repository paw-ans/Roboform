                    <p class="section-content">
                        If you're having issues with RoboForm not working properly, you can try the following troubleshooting steps:
                    </p>
                    <ul class="section-content">
                        <li><strong>Update RoboForm:</strong> Make sure that you are using the latest version of RoboForm. Check for updates from within the app or visit the download page on the RoboForm website.</li>
                        <li><strong>Reinstall the Software:</strong> If RoboForm isn’t opening or is malfunctioning, try uninstalling and then reinstalling the application.</li>
                        <li><strong>Verify Your Subscription:</strong> If your subscription has expired or is inactive, you may lose access to certain features. Check your subscription status and renew it if necessary.</li>
                        <li><strong>Check Your Internet Connection:</strong> RoboForm requires an internet connection for syncing data across devices. Make sure you're connected to the internet.</li>
                        <li><strong>Disable Conflicting Software:</strong> Some other software, like third-party firewalls or antivirus programs, may interfere with RoboForm. Temporarily disable them and see if that resolves the issue.</li>
